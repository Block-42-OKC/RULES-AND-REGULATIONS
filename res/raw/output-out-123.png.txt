ARTICLE 4
ROADWAYS AND PARKING AREAS

Each parking garage and carport is for the exclusive use of the Owner (or tenant) of
the Unit to which it is assigned. Other parking areas are for Owners, tenants, and for a limited
number of guests and visitors. Vehicles parked in unauthorized or restricted areas, including areas
assigned to other Owners, will be towed away at the vehicle owner's expense.

4.1 Please maintain safe and proper speeds while driving in the garage areas and
on the drive. There are blind spots present.

4.2 Please use oil-catching and absorbing materials underneath your vehicle (as

may be approved by the Board) to prevent excessive staining. Please monitor the condition of those
materials and replace or clean when necessary. Excessive oil leaks and stains caused by a vehicle
will be cause for fines being imposed and/or an assessment for the cost of clean-up and repairs.
Preventative maintenance of your vehicle will help to alleviate this issue.

4.3. Deeded or assigned garages, carports and/or parking spaces are for the
exclusive use of an Owner of an Unit or such Owner’s tenant, and may not be leased; sub-leased,
sold, or otherwise separately conveyed apart from the conveyance of such Unit.
